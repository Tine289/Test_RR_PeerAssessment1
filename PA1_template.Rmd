```{r, include=FALSE}

## 1. Loading and Preprocessing Data
```{r Activity Data, echo=TRUE }
activity <- read.csv("C://Users/tsc029/Desktop/R/repdata_data_activity/activity.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE, na.strings = "NA" )
activity <- transform(activity,  date = factor(date))
```

## 2. The mean number of steps taken per day

```{r Steps per day, echo = TRUE}
aggActivity <- aggregate(steps~ date , data = activity, FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(aggActivity$steps, xlab = "Number of steps per day", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Number of steps per day", col = "yellow")
```

Average Number of Steps per Day
```{r MeanSteps, echo= TRUE}
MeanSteps <- mean(aggActivity$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
print(MeanSteps)
```

Median Number of Steps per Day
```{r MedianSteps, echo=TRUE}
Steps_Med <- median(aggActivity$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
print(Steps_Med)
```

## 3. Average Daily Activity Pattern

```{r Average Daily Activity Pattern, echo=TRUE}
stepsPerInterval_mean <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean, na.rm =TRUE)
plot(stepsPerInterval_mean$interval, stepsPerInterval_mean$steps, type = "l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps per interval", lwd = 1.5, col = "steelblue", main = "Average Number of Steps per Interval")
```
### 5-minute interval with the maximum number of steps
 
Maximum average steps (no.) in an interval: 
```{r MaximumAverageSteps, echo=TRUE}
MaximumAverageSteps <- max(stepsPerInterval_mean$steps)
print(MaximumAverageSteps)
```
Interval (no.) with maximum average steps:

```{r MaximumAverageInterval, echo=TRUE}
MaximumAverageInterval  <- stepsPerInterval_mean$interval[which(stepsPerInterval_mean$steps == MaximumAverageSteps)]
print(MaximumAverageInterval)
```

## 4. Imputing missing values

The total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs):
```{r Total NAs, echo= TRUE}
sum(is.na(activity))
```

### Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 

```{r MissingValues, echo=TRUE}
NA_total <- subset(activity, is.na(steps))
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
#Missing values per date
hist(as.numeric(NA_total$date), breaks = 61, xlab = "Day", main = "Missing values per date")

#Missing values per interval
hist(NA_total$interval, xlab= "Interval", main = "Missing values per interval")

```
Conclusion: As missing values are evenly distributed across intervals, but not for dates, filling in strategy by the former is applied. 

### Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r ImputedActivity, echo=TRUE}

# Calculate mean of steps per interval
StepsPerInterval2_mean <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# Split the 'activity' dataset by 'with' and 'without NAs'
activity_NA <- activity[is.na(activity$steps),]
activity_wo_NA <- activity[!is.na(activity$steps),]

#Fill in missing values in activity_NAs by 
activity_NA$steps <- as.factor(activity_NA$interval)
levels(activity_NA$steps) <- StepsPerInterval2_mean

#Change the vector back as integer 
levels(activity_NA$steps) <- round(as.numeric(levels(activity_NA$steps)))
activity_NA$steps <- as.integer(as.vector(activity_NA$steps))

#Merge datasets 
imputed_activity <- rbind(activity_NA, activity_wo_NA)
```

### Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r ImputedSteps, echo = TRUE}
activity_imp <- aggregate(steps~ date, data = imputed_activity, FUN = sum)
hist(activity_imp$steps, xlab = "Number of steps per day", ylab = "Frequency", main = "Number of Steps per Day (NAs Imputed)", col = "lightsalmon")
```


### Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?

Average Number of Steps per Day (NAs imputed)
```{r AverageSteps_Imp, echo= TRUE}
AverageSteps_Imp <- mean(activity_imp$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
print(AverageSteps_Imp)
```

Median Number of Steps per Day (NAs imputed)
```{r MedianSteps, echo=TRUE}
Imp_MedianSteps <- median(activity_imp$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
print(Imp_MedianSteps)
```

### What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

The impact of imputing steps is minor, with a slight decrease in both mean and median number of steps per day. 

## 5. Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

### Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r WeekdayVWeekend, echo= TRUE}
# 'day' variable with levels 'weekday' and 'weekend' added to dataset 
#elseif function to categorize Saturday and Sunday as factor level "weekend", all the rest as "weekday"

imputed_activity$day<- ifelse(as.POSIXlt(imputed_activity$date)$wday %in% c(0,6), "weekends","weekdays")

#Factorization of 'day'
imputed_activity$day <- factor(imputed_activity$day)

```

### Make a panel plot containing a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). 
```{r Weekday/Weekend Plots, echo=TRUE }
#Aggregate mean steps per intervall and Weekday/Weekend
day_interval_steps <- aggregate(steps~ interval + day, data = imputed_activity, FUN = mean)
#Inspect data frame
head(day_interval_steps)
#Make plot
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(day_interval_steps, aes(x=interval, y=steps, col = day))
g+  geom_line()+  
  facet_wrap(~ day, ncol = 1, nrow = 2)+
  labs(title = "Daily activity pattern (NAs imputed)")+  
  labs(x= "Interval")+  labs(y= "Steps")
```
